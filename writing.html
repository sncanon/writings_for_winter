<h1>Writing Tips</h1>

<h2>Plagiarism Advice</h2>
<hr>
<p><em>Hi all! Throughout my unfortunately substantial experience with my work being stolen, I’ve learned a lot of really useful tips to deal with plagiarism. I hope these help!</em></p>

<p><ul>
  <li>Whenever you post your own work on a site, make sure to attribute your name or url to it.
<li>One of the easiest ways to find plagiarism of your work is to copy and paste lines from your work into Google. If they’ve been stolen, chances are results will pop up.
<li>When you find a result, contact the ‘author’ of the plagiarized piece first. Ask them to remove it or to provide credit to you.
<li>If they decline, contact the owner of the site the ‘author’ has posted your work on, and ask them to remove it. Provide them with links of both your original work and the thief’s work, as well as date stamps to show that your piece was written or posted first. Screenshots too.
<li>If the owner refuses to remove the piece, go to the following website (<a href="https://www.whoishostingthis.com" target="blank">www.whoishostingthis.com</a>), and type in the name of the site your stolen work is posted on. This will reveal what company or site is hosting the site your work is on.
<li>Once the hosting site pops up, email or contact their abuse department with the same info (screenshots, urls, links, etc) you originally provided the first site owner. Ask them to remove the piece. Make sure to provide them with a formal DMCA notification. You can easily generate one <a href="https://www.whoishostingthis.com/resources/dmca/" target="_blank">here</a> and it only takes about 2 minutes.
<li>This last step should almost always work. If it doesn’t, you have every right to threaten legal action unless the hosting site complies with your request to have your stolen work removed.

<h2>Do you have any advice for aspiring writers?</h2>
<hr>
<p>I’ve lost track of how many times I have been asked this question and I dread it every time.

<p>Trust your own advice above anyone else’s. Try to stop asking this question of others and instead ask yourself. Do your own work and your own research. If you fixate too much on what everyone else is doing, your work won’t be your work anymore. You’ll think their way is better when maybe yours actually is. You might lose your originality. Trust your gut, not theirs.

<p>Ironically, I just gave you advice. But this is one of the most important lessons I’ve learned throughout my years writing.</p>

<h2>Do all of your poems stem from personal experience? I'm just starting out as a writer and I'm wondering if it's ok to write about things I haven't experienced or is that lying?</h2>
<hr>
<p>Not all of mine stem from personal experience - for instance, I write a great deal of pieces about Greek mythology and pieces with fantasy themes. However, if I am writing a piece about a subject I have no personal experience with, I always do research and I will never write about a subject I feel as if I do not have the right to talk about or voice, or a subject I feel as if I do not have enough empathy for.

<p>My constant writing motto is  “ Writers don’t write from experience. Writers write from empathy” by Nikki Giovanni.

<p>I believe that as long as you follow those rules, it is okay to write about a subject you have not personally experienced.

<p>But never EVER pretend to suffer from something you actually do not in your writing. Ever. Never pretend as if you are an alcoholic in your writing, for instance. Pretend as if the character or narrator is, if you have to. It is never okay to claim an identify for yourself in your writing that you do not possess in real life, especially an identity that is oppressed. If you want examples, look up Michael Derrick Hudson.

<p>There is a huge difference between pretending to be someone, and your character or narrator pretending to be someone.</p>
