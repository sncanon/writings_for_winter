								<span>Meggie Royer</span>
								<span>Survival Songs</span>
							</h3>
							<p><em>Survival Songs</em> is a rerelease of Meggie Royer's first collection of poems, which was a finalist in the GoodReads Choice Awards for the Best Poetry Book of 2013. The poems and prose in <em>Survival Songs</em> are clear and concise. Grounded through experiences, Royer's evocative poems cast a knowing eye on the wider world, telling us what it’s like to be displaced and replaced, used and abused. Her poems are suffused with a graceful, mysterious pathos and longing. Survival Songs is a remarkable debut.<br>

<strong>EVEN IF</strong><br>
And even if her whole body looks like a watercolor painting, that doesn’t mean
you can dip your hands into the palettes of her hips and brush between her legs.
And even if her smile seems as inviting as a chandelier, don’t try
hanging yourself from the ceiling of her thighs just to get a glimpse inside.
And even if her dress is already halfway off, do the math. The two letters that make up “No” will never equal the three letters of a “Yes.”</p>

													<div class="bk-content">
														<p>And even if you’re hungry like a wolf, lust isn’t love,
														so keep your paws and teeth to yourself.
														And even if there’s drinking involved, remember she isn’t drunk on you
														so don’t try to put her further under the influence, especially
														when the influence is you. And even if you want to stick your tongue down her throat like a metal pole in winter,
														that doesn’t mean you can’t try getting yourself unpeeled first. Thaw your greediness before letting yourself get frozen in the wrong path.</p>

														And even if she doesn’t look like your narrow-minded image of a woman,
														then maybe the magnifying glass you’re using is cracked and dirty
														and raping her certainly won’t turn her into the person you want her to be. And even if she’s passed out and no one else is around,
														try “passing” on the opportunity to ruin her life instead.
														And even if you think saying a prayer before breaking down
														the church of her body is going to save you, it won’t.</p>

													</div>
													<div class="bk-content">

													<span>Meggie Royer</span>
													<span>The No You Never Listened To</span>
												</h3>
												<p>"Meggie typically takes the universal and makes it personal. With <em>The No You Never Listened To</em>, she takes the <em>personal</em> and makes it <em>universal</em>. As a sexual assault survivor, Meggie is well-acquainted with trauma: the aftermath, the guilt, the anger. She has never shied away from taking Hemingway’s advice – write hard and clear about what hurts – and that strength has never been more of an asset than with this body of work.</p>

<p>em>The No You Never Listened To</em> is the book you will wish you’d had when trauma climbed into your bed. It is the book you will give to friends who are dragged from their “before” into a dark and terrifying “after”. And yes, it is the book you will wish didn’t exist.</p>

<p>But it is also the one that will remind you, in your darkest moments, where the blame really belongs. It will remind you that your memory will not always be an enemy. And it will remind you that none of us have ever been alone in this.”</p>

																		<div class="bk-content">
																			<p>Unrequited love is exhausting, almost physically draining, like teetering on the edge of recovery after being home sick for two weeks. But the problem with unrequited love is that there’s no cure, no chicken soup or bedrest to make you feel better again. The heart is a fickle organ, the most unpredictable in the body, and it wants what it wants for sometimes unknowable reasons.</p>
																		</div>
																		<div class="bk-content">
																			<p>Imagine what it must have been like for Adam and Eve, the first man and woman, just trying out their hearts for the first time. No instruction manual, no step-by-step rules that laid out the foundation and the uses. And if Adam didn’t love Eve, or vice versa, there would be no one else to project that unused love onto, no placebo.</p>
																		</div>
																		<div class="bk-content bk-content-current">
																			<p>When you see the one you love with someone else, it’s all you can do not to rip your heart out and throw it on the floor and declare your love to the whole world, to smash every plate in the cupboard or paint the walls with their name. It’s gut-wrenching, like asking for the whole universe and only receiving the stars instead.</p>

																								<p><strong>Losing Touch</strong><br>
															The first day of class, the professor tells us about a man who has no memory,
															who forgets something as soon as he sees it. We immediately begin
															to discuss all the particulars, wonder how he could possibly even talk
															if every word vanished as soon as it appeared. And I thought of fireflies
															flashing Morse code in the dark, or how the thunder makes love so violently
															to the lightning that every crash of their bodies can be heard from above.

																								How language always fails us when we need it most, like holding the hand

																								the world for the last time, to take in the sky deepening into pink ash
																								over the horizon, and her lover, two hours away, trying desperately
																								to make it in time on the subway. The professor tells us Freud would eat that up, would say something witty about that man’s</p>

																								But all I can think about is how, unlike the woman whose heart
																								is slowly failing her, crushed underneath the steering wheel,
																								everything that man sees
																								he sees for the first time. Every time his wife steps into a room,
																								he would be laying his eyes upon her for the very first time.
																								For him, falling in love wouldn’t be a luxury;
